# 🚀 LeetCode Problem Solving Journey by Megha Ashok Rabagannavar

Welcome to my curated collection of LeetCode problems!  
This repository documents my problem-solving journey, with structured folders for each question including:

✅ Problem Statement (just like on LeetCode)  
✅ Examples & Constraints  
✅ Java Solution with Comments  
✅ Time & Space Complexity Analysis  
✅ Difficulty Level

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each folder is named after the problem and includes its own `README.md` and `solution.java` file.
